### Hello! My name is Angelo Darwiche

I'm a student in the Game Development program at Malm√∂ University, where I've developed small games and projects in C# and C++. 
I've worked with the following:
- Game Designer for multiple projects as lead game designer along with @EdgarSjoberg
- 3D modelling in Maya and Blender Databases
- Multithreading
- Datastructures and Algorithms
- Planning and structuring project using System Development standards
- AI for videogames

In all of my works I've always aimed to collaborate with others as I strongly believe that no project can be done without the help from others, no matter how large or small said help is. 
These are some of the talented people I've collaborated with so far:

- @EdgarSjoberg
- @Allan-Majid
- @Culliiing
- @LisaMyhrMan

Beyond schoolwork and hobbies, I am also working on a passion project called Project Cyberfantasy. You can check out our progress by following this [link](https://github.com/EdgarSjoberg/ProjectCyberfantasy).
For this project, we are learning Unreal Engine 5 and Visual Scripting. All assets, music and more will be developed by us internally with the aid from friends and collaborators.
